Here’s a crisp, source-based review (in English) of AngelHive (angelhive.io) and its Pynn underlay, focused on winning startup sign-ups.

What’s working (with evidence)

Clear core offer + working funnel. The homepage promises AI-driven startup reports and routes “Get Started” straight to the app (login/signup); the app lives on angelhive.pynn.ai, confirming Pynn is the delivery layer. 
AngelHive
+1

Segmented messaging. There are distinct pages for Startups (via the homepage/Features) and Investors (investor page), each with tailored copy and pricing CTAs, including a free option and a low-price report. 
AngelHive
+1

Policy surface area is solid. Up-to-date Terms (24-06-2025) and Privacy pages, plus a specific LinkedIn Data Usage Policy that discloses scraping and that processed data “may be displayed within Pynn AI reports.” This is a strong compliance signal for early-stage products.

White-label/tenant motion exists. There’s a public “Create Your Startup Platform” flow under angelhive.pynn.ai/new-tenant (and other live tenants), proving the multi-tenant SaaS behind the scenes.

Pynn narrative + capital plan. Pynn’s site positions itself as the “intelligence layer” for Europe and even advertises an Oct 2025 €500k seed—useful for credibility with B2B prospects. 
pynn.ai

What’s holding it back

Brand/domain confusion. The homepage’s “Powered by Pynn AI” links to pynnai.com while the product actually runs on pynn.ai and angelhive.pynn.ai. That split weakens brand signals and can dilute SEO equity and user trust. 
AngelHive

Inconsistent proof & counters. The homepage shows “0+ Active Startups/Investors”—that’s a trust negative; hide counters until they’re meaningful. 
AngelHive

Inconsistent offer framing. Report length varies by page: “34+ pages” on the hero, “35 pages” on Features, “20 pages” in homepage pricing—looks sloppy to evaluators. 
AngelHive
+1

Typos/grammar. Examples on the homepage: “understund” and “desgined.” These are small but costly credibility hits in an investor-facing product. 
AngelHive

Mixed conversion path. Startup CTAs jump to a login wall rather than a friction-free “start the free summary report” first-run. That’s extra friction at the top of funnel. 
app.angelhive.io

Name collision risk. A separate site, angelhive.vc (women-led focus, US address), competes on the same brand name—worth addressing to protect brand SERP and avoid investor/startup confusion. 
angelhive.vc

My “barometers” to track monthly

Brand SERP ownership: % of first-page results that are your properties (angelhive.io, app.angelhive.io, pynn.ai). Aim ≥8/10 unique results. Evidence of cross-linking today is messy. 
AngelHive
+1

Homepage conversion rate (brand traffic → first action): “Get started” click-through and first report started (not just account created). Current path goes to login; measure drop-off there. 
app.angelhive.io

Activation: % of sign-ups that complete the free summary report within 24–48h. The Features page promises this—make sure analytics reflects it. 
AngelHive

Investor intent capture: % of investor page visitors who join waitlist or request curated dealflow. 
AngelHive

Domain coherence score: Number of live, user-visible domains in the funnel (angelhive.io, app.angelhive.io → angelhive.pynn.ai, pynn.ai, pynnai.com). Target: consolidate to two. 
AngelHive

Policy coverage & clarity: Time since last update to Terms/Privacy/LinkedIn Policy and % of pages referencing Pynn correctly. Currently good but slightly inconsistent in naming.

Recommendations (prioritized)
0–30 days (low lift, high impact)

Unify the brand & domains.

Make pynnai.com 301 → pynn.ai and ensure all “Powered by” links point to pynn.ai. Keep app.angelhive.io but transparently show “Running on Pynn” with consistent naming. 
AngelHive
+1

Fix copy & consistency.

Standardize report length (pick one: e.g., “35-page investor-ready report”) across Homepage, Features, Pricing. Correct typos on the homepage. 
AngelHive
+1

Hide or replace zero counters.

Swap “0+” badges for social proof: logos, testimonials, or a “Sample report” preview block (you already link a sample PDF). 
AngelHive

Reduce first-click friction for startups.

Let users start the free summary before full signup (progressive profiling). The Features page promises an instant one-pager—make that the default first run. 
AngelHive

Clarify Pynn relationship.

On AngelHive’s footer or a short explainer, state: “AngelHive’s assessments are generated by Pynn. Your data is processed by Pynn under our Privacy Policy.” Link both policies. 
AngelHive
+1

31–90 days (medium lift)

Own the brand SERP.

Publish an About page (team, location, governance) and a Methodology explainer; add Organization and WebSite structured data on the homepage to strengthen site identity. (Your current pages imply the method but don’t consolidate it.) 
AngelHive

Create intent-mapped content.

For startups: “How to prepare an investor-ready profile,” “Sample 35-page AI report walkthrough.”

For investors: “How to run 80% faster screening with AI,” “Risk scoring: what matters.” Link all to a demo that collects emails after the first 2–3 sections. 
AngelHive

Split funnels cleanly.

AngelHive = marketplace/assessments. Pynn = white-label/enterprise. Keep AngelHive CTAs focused on “Start free report / Publish profile,” and route enterprise leads to pynn.ai—not to mixed destinations. 
pynn.ai

Add proof assets.

Case studies, event partnerships, and tenant logos (you have working tenants on *.pynn.ai). Add quotes/screens of real reports (with permission) to reduce perceived risk. 
womeninvestinwomen.pynnai.com
+1

Tighten legal copy alignment.

Ensure Terms/Privacy/LinkedIn pages all use the same Pynn naming and contact language (tiny inconsistencies exist). 
AngelHive
+2
AngelHive

Nice-to-have (quarterly)

Interactive sample report (not just a PDF): collapsible sections with gated export (email capture). 
AngelHive

Investor marketplace launch page with a dated roadmap and public counter that only appears after a threshold (e.g., “500+ startups live”). 
AngelHive

Performance pass. Compress hero media, lazy-load images, and verify Core Web Vitals across pages (WordPress PDF path hints at a media-heavy stack). 
AngelHive

TL;DR

The value prop is compelling and the Pynn plumbing is real, but brand coherence and basic polish are in the way. If you: (1) consolidate domains/links, (2) remove friction to the promised free summary, (3) fix copy/proof inconsistencies, and (4) publish a couple of high-intent content pieces, you should see an immediate lift in startup sign-ups and investor activations.

Thought for 2m 24s

Here’s a neutral, source-based report on AngelHive (angelhive.io) and its relationship to Pynn—with attention to how Google sometimes surfaces the Terms of Service above the homepage.

Scope & date

Assessment date: 29 Sep 2025 (Europe/Madrid).

Sources: publicly available pages on angelhive.io, app.angelhive.io → angelhive.pynn.ai, pynn.ai, pynnai.com, and Google guidance. Citations follow each point.

Snapshot of what the site offers

Proposition (homepage): AI-powered startup evaluation reports to help founders pitch and investors screen; homepage hero references “34+ pages” of insights. 
AngelHive

Pricing/feature copy: In different places the full report is described as 20 pages (homepage & investor page) and 35 pages (features page). 
AngelHive

AngelHive

Policies: Terms of Service and Privacy Policy last updated June 24, 2025. A separate Publication Terms page lists introduction-fee rules (effective 01 Jan 2025). 
AngelHive

AngelHive
+2

Observations (neutral)
1) SERP behavior: Terms page visibility

In spot checks, Google surfaces both /terms-of-service/ and the homepage for brand queries; the Terms page can appear prominently (and may appear above the homepage depending on query/location/time). This is consistent with Google’s canonical/title-link systems, which can prefer clearer or strongly linked pages. 
Google for Developers

AngelHive

AngelHive
+3

Why this can happen (per Google):

Google may choose a different canonical than the site’s preference, and it generates “title links” from multiple on-page/off-page sources. Strong internal links to legal pages can amplify their prominence. 
Google for Developers

2) Architecture & hosting

CTA path: “Get Started” on angelhive.io opens app.angelhive.io, which resolves to angelhive.pynn.ai (login/signup). This evidences hosting/application delivery on Pynn’s multi-tenant platform. 
AngelHive
+1

Multi-tenant evidence: A public “Create Your Startup Platform” flow lives at angelhive.pynn.ai/new-tenant with subdomain provisioning on .pynn.ai. 
angelhive.pynn.ai

3) Brand/domain coherence

Homepage header includes “Powered by Pynn AI” linking to pynnai.com, while the product/app runs under pynn.ai and angelhive.pynn.ai. This introduces cross-domain variance for users and search engines. 
AngelHive

pynn.ai positions Pynn as an “innovation intelligence” platform and announces an Oct 2025 €500k seed round; pynnai.com is a separate site with its own pages/policies.

4) Content & editorial consistency

The homepage contains minor spelling inconsistencies (e.g., “understund”, “desgined”). Neutral note: editorial items can affect perceived polish. 
AngelHive

5) Audience funnels

Startups: Free entry points are promised (e.g., free summary report on “Features”), but first action from homepage leads to a login/sign-up wall, not a pre-sign-up preview flow. 
AngelHive
+1

Investors: Dedicated page outlines a free access tier plus a €19 “Evaluate a startup” option, again listing 20 pages for the report. 
AngelHive

6) External references

Press/mentions: Public launch coverage in May 2024; third-party directory pages describe reports as “34+ pages.” (External descriptions may drive expectation and should match first-party copy.) 
Yahoo Finance
+1

Name collision: angelhive.vc (women-led focus) is a separate entity; appears on brand queries and can share the brand space. 
Angel Hive

“Barometers” to track monthly (neutral KPIs)

Brand SERP composition: Count how many page-one results for “AngelHive” are your controlled domains vs. third parties; flag when policy pages outrank the homepage. 
AngelHive
+1

Homepage → First Action Rate: % of brand visitors who click “Get started” and reach the first meaningful product step (not just login view). Track drop-off on the angelhive.pynn.ai/auth pages. 
app.angelhive.io

Startup activation: % of new sign-ups that complete the “free summary” within 48h (as promised on Features). 
AngelHive

Investor engagement: % of investor-page sessions that join waitlist/start an evaluation. 
AngelHive

Domain coherence metric: Number of distinct user-visible domains in the core funnel (angelhive.io, app.angelhive.io → angelhive.pynn.ai, pynn.ai, pynnai.com). Lower is simpler.

Neutral recommendations
A) Address SERP case where ToS ranks above homepage

Ensure homepage is the strongest canonical target and has clear, unique main title/H1; review internal linking so that homepage receives consistent sitewide prominence (per Google guidance on canonicalization and title links). 
Google for Developers
+1

Add or confirm WebSite/Organization structured data on the homepage to reinforce site identity (“site name”) in Search. 
Google for Developers
+1

B) Harmonize domain signals

Make the “Powered by Pynn AI” links consistent with the live underlay (pynn.ai) or explain the relationship if pynnai.com is intentionally separate. Consistency reduces user confusion and consolidates equity. 
AngelHive

C) Unify product messaging

Standardize the report length and language across homepage, features, investor, and any PDFs or third-party profiles to avoid mixed expectations (20 vs 34+ vs 35). 
AngelHive
+2
AngelHive
+2

D) Reduce initial friction for startups

If feasible, allow a pre-login preview of the free summary (or a sample flow that ends with gated export) so “Get started” equals visible progress before account creation. This aligns with the promise on the Features page. 
AngelHive

E) Editorial pass

Correct minor spelling issues on the homepage (e.g., “understund”, “desgined”) for clarity and professionalism.

Bottom line (neutral)

AngelHive presents a clear AI-evaluation offering and routes usage through a Pynn-hosted application. The current search behavior—where policy pages can feature prominently—has recognizable causes per Google’s systems. Normalizing copy, tightening domain signals, and clarifying first-click experience are straightforward ways to reduce ambiguity for both users and search engines, while keeping the relationship to Pynn transparent.
