Pynn is the white-label platform; AngelHive is a branded tenant using it. Pynn advertises “a white-label platform … for investors, incubators, accelerators…” and links users to AngelHive to try reports; Pynn also exposes a self-serve tenant creator (…/new-tenant) and live third-party tenants (e.g., womeninvestinwomen.pynn.ai). \nWomen Invest in Women\n+3\nPynn\n+3\nPynn\n+3\n\nCurrent web footprint. The public marketing site angelhive.io is a small brochure site with very few indexable pages (e.g., Features, Investor, Privacy/Terms, an empty Uncategorised blog archive). It appears to run on WordPress (evidence: wp-content/uploads in live URLs and WP category URLs). The application lives on app.angelhive.io and resolves to a Pynn tenant (angelhive.pynn.ai). \nAngelHive\n+5\nAngelHive\n+5\nAngelHive\n+5\n\nBrand collision in Google. Searches for “Angelhive / Angel Hive” return a different organization at angelhive.vc (women-led investing community) plus LinkedIn entries, which dilutes intent and clicks for angelhive.io. \nangelhive.vc\n+2\nangelhive.vc\n+2\n\nDifferentiation gap. Market leaders (PitchBook / Preqin) win on data breadth + distribution + authority. PitchBook alone generated $618.4M revenue in 2024, ~3.2M monthly web visits, and keeps compounding via Morningstar distribution. AngelHive/Pynn has neither the content scale nor the authority signals yet. \ns21.q4cdn.com\n+2\nSimilarweb\n+2\n\nBottom line. To grow organic traffic meaningfully, AngelHive needs:\n\nclearer positioning vs “Angel Hive” and vs data incumbents;\n\ntechnical SEO (architecture, CWV, schema, SSR),\n\na programmatic, data-backed content moat (thousands of indexable, useful pages), and\n\ndistribution (ecosystem partnerships + PR) with clean white-label SEO guardrails.\n\nHow AngelHive & Pynn fit together\n\nPynn = platform; AngelHive = a tenant & showcase. Pynn’s site explicitly pitches a white-label solution and points to AngelHive as the place to “test our reports.” The app domain for AngelHive (app.angelhive.io) redirects to angelhive.pynn.ai and Pynn exposes self-serve tenant provisioning (…/new-tenant), confirming the model. \nPynn\n+2\nAngelHive\n+2\n\nMultiple live tenants exist. Example: womeninvestinwomen.pynn.ai with standard login flows and invitations—evidence of the white-label, multi-tenant pattern. \nWomen Invest in Women\n+1\n\nIs AngelHive a white-labelled solution?\nYes—AngelHive is a branded front for Pynn’s white-label evaluation/reporting platform (marketing on angelhive.io + app on pynn.ai). \nPynn\n+1\n\nTechnical & content audit (AngelHive)\n\nStack & structure\n\nMarketing site: WordPress traces (e.g., wp-content/uploads/..., category/uncategorised/). This is fine for speed if optimized, but schema, internal linking and CWV need attention. \nAngelHive\n+1\n\nApp: hosted on Pynn. Pynn’s own hiring indicates React/Node/Mongo stack, consistent with a SPA. (So: App likely React; marketing site not.) \nHubMub\n\nIndexable surface\n\nVery few public pages (Home, Features, Investor, Terms, Privacy). Blog category is empty (no topical authority). No visible structured data (no JSON-LD detected on key pages). This limits keyword coverage and sitelinks. \nAngelHive\n+3\nAngelHive\n+3\nAngelHive\n+3\n\nBrand/UX\n\n“AngelHive” collides with angelhive.vc; both discuss investing. This causes user confusion and CTR loss on brand queries. \nangelhive.vc\n\nCompliance & policies (good)\n\nUpdated Terms and Privacy (June 24, 2025); a LinkedIn data usage page—these are trust signals that should be surfaced via schema/org markup. \nAngelHive\n+2\nAngelHive\n+2\n\nWhy traffic is likely low (root causes)\n\nMinimal content & topical authority. No blog/library, few indexable routes, and no structured data → very few keywords rank. \nAngelHive\n\nBrand conflict. Competing “Angel Hive” entity ranks and siphons brand intent. \nangelhive.vc\n\nApp behind auth. The valuable “report” content lives behind login; no public, link-worthy artifacts exist (samples are PDF and not scaled). \nAngelHive\n\nWhite-label duplication risk. Multiple tenants can create near-duplicate marketing/app pages across subdomains unless templating is differentiated—Google’s 2024–2025 crackdowns (site-reputation abuse/parasite SEO, paid links, doorway pages) make duplication & thin pages risky. \nThe Verge\n+1\n\nCompetitive benchmark: why PitchBook gets massive traffic & a huge valuation\n\nData moat + distribution. PitchBook posts $618.4M (2024) revenue, rising users and high margins, with Morningstar’s global sales machine. Web visits are ~3.2M/month (Similarweb est.). \ns21.q4cdn.com\n+2\nMorningstar Newsroom\n+2\n\nStrategic M&A & ecosystem. Morningstar folded LCD into PitchBook and keeps compounding. BlackRock’s $3.2B Preqin deal shows how private-markets data platforms command premium multiples. \nAxios\n+1\n\nTakeaway: They don’t win on “a nicer report page.” They win by owning the nouns of the industry (companies, funds, people, rounds, deals) and shipping millions of crawlable facts with editorial/analyst content layered on top.\n\nMorningstar Inc (MORN)\n$237.11\n+$1.24\n(+0.53%)\nToday\n1D\n5D\n1M\n6M\nYTD\n1Y\n5Y\nMAX\nOpen\n236.04\nVolume\n1.1M\nDay Low\n232.95\nDay High\n237.33\nYear Low\n230.86\nYear High\n365.00\nHow AngelHive currently shows up in Google\n\nStrong reliance on paid/owned mentions and partner pages (e.g., ThatRound, Yahoo Finance PR), weak on organic informational queries. Brand SERP is crowded by angelhive.vc and generic social. \nthatround.com\n+2\nYahoo Finance\n+2\n\nRecommended strategy (from safe SEO to “what not to do”)\n1) Positioning & information architecture\n\nSeparate the brands cleanly. Decide: Is “AngelHive” a marketplace brand and “Pynn” the platform brand? If yes, lean into Pynn for B2B (white-label) and AngelHive for the founder/investor marketplace, each with distinct keyword maps.\n\nResolve brand collision. Options: (a) rename or qualify the marketplace (e.g., AngelHive Market / AngelHive Europe) and secure exact-match social handles; (b) claim Knowledge Panel via structured data; (c) PR to disambiguate. (The .vc site is entrenched.) \nangelhive.vc\n\n2) Technical SEO foundations (90-day sprint)\n\nConsolidate marketing to a modern SSR stack (e.g., Next.js/Astro fronted by a headless CMS or keep WP + implement server-side caching & static rendering). Ensure core web vitals, caching, image compression, and clean HTML.\n\nAdd schema everywhere: Organization, Product/SoftwareApplication, FAQPage, HowTo, Review, BreadcrumbList. No JSON-LD found on key pages today. \nAngelHive\n+1\n\nSitemaps & robots. Generate segmented sitemaps (marketing, programmatic, tenant directories).\n\nProgrammatic SEO guardrails for the white-label: enforce unique titles, intros, partner-specific case studies, and localized examples on each tenant; block templated junk from index; ship canonical tags and hreflang if localized. (Google’s recent updates penalize thin/duplicative patterns, including third-party “parasite SEO”.) \nThe Verge\n\n3) Content strategy (the traffic engine)\n\nOwn the nouns. Publish public, indexable profile pages for startups, investors, verticals, cities, events, frameworks, etc.—derived from your data but with unique value per page (summary stats, trendlines, curated links). This is how PitchBook/Preqin accrue links & queries.\n\nEvergreen libraries: “How to raise in 🇪🇺,” “Due diligence checklists,” “Market maps,” “Term sheet explainers,” “Valuation by sector”—mapped to high-intent keywords.\n\nData-driven editorials & PR: Quarterly “State of European Seed,” “Angel Activity by Country,” “Top AI Angels in DACH,” etc. Each with downloadable CSV and deep-linkable charts.\n\nInteractive tools: Free valuation sanity checker, deck grader, funding probability simulator that emit shareable result pages (unique URLs).\n\nDistribution: Syndicate with newsletters (Sifted, EU tech communities), university incubators, and angel networks.\n\n4) Partnerships & list-building\n\nOffer free white-label minis to accelerators/incubators (limited seats) in exchange for co-branded public directories and backlinks.\n\nAPI & embeds: Allow partners to embed startup lists and auto-link back to your canonical pages.\n\n5) Measurement & stack\n\nGA4 + Search Console + privacy-safe event tracking. Use a rank tracker, log-based analytics, and content inventory dashboards (crawl budget, orphan pages, indexation).\n\nBudget scenarios (first 6 months)\nTrack\tWhat you get\tEst. monthly (EUR)\nLean\t1 FTE growth engineer; technical SEO; ship 2K–5K programmatic pages; 4 editorial posts/mo; lean PR; outreach to 20 partners/mo\t€8k–€12k\nCore\t+ fractional SEO lead; designer; 10K+ programmatic pages; 8 posts/mo; 2 interactive tools; 60 quality backlinks/mo (earned/outreach); PR wire/briefings\t€20k–€35k\nScale\t+ data engineer; analyst; 25K+ pages; 12 posts/mo; research report/quarter; 3 tools; conference sponsorships; multilingual; video; analyst interviews\t€45k–€80k\n\nOne-offs / infra: Lighthouse/CWV hardening (€4k–€8k), schema/analytics implementation (€3k–€6k), data pipelines to publish programmatic pages (€8k–€20k), brand/legal (as needed).\n\nNotes:\n\nLink building budget is for legit digital PR/outreach. Avoid buying links; if you sponsor content, mark links appropriately (rel=\"sponsored\"). \nGoogle for Developers\n\nThe biggest ROI comes from programmatic content + distribution. Expect the traffic curve to accelerate as inventory grows.\n\nYour role (Growth Engineer) & compensation\n\nWhat you (a skilled Python dev) can own:\n\nProgrammatic SEO: ETL from app DB → static page generator (Next.js SSG/Astro), safe templating, canonicalization, and per-tenant uniqueness.\n\nInteractive tools: build graders/estimators exposing shareable result pages.\n\nData quality: dedupe entities, entity resolution (companies/people/funds), and light enrichment.\n\nTracking & experiments: event pipelines, UTM discipline, content tests.\n\nAutomation: partner onboarding scripts, sitemap/regeneration jobs, internal linking graph.\n\nMarket comp (Spain/Madrid as baseline, total annual)\n\nSenior Software Engineer: median €52k–€90k total comp; averages vary by source (Glassdoor/Levels/Payscale). Data roles trend ~€40k–€67k. A growth-engineering lead with broad scope typically lands €60k–€100k base (+bonus/equity). \nPayscale\n+3\nLevels.fyi\n+3\nGlassdoor\n+3\n\nRecommend base €65k–€85k + 10–20% bonus + meaningful options tied to traffic, SQLs, and revenue milestones.\n\nShould the site be “more unique”? Yes—concretely, do this\n\nDifferentiate the marketplace: “AngelHive Europe: AI-assessed early-stage marketplace” (or similar), with public startup & investor directories by country/vertical.\n\nPer-tenant uniqueness: Each Pynn tenant must ship distinct copy, case studies, pricing pages, and localized taxonomies to avoid duplication penalties post Google’s site-reputation/parasite SEO crackdowns. \nThe Verge\n\nPublish the data exhaust: Every analysis dimension (team, market, traction, risk) should have its own explainer, glossary, and benchmark page—all interlinked.\n\nIs it built with React?\n\nApp: Likely React/Node (per Pynn’s hiring).\n\nMarketing: AngelHive marketing pages show WordPress patterns today. Migration to Next.js/Astro (or keep WP headless) is recommended for speed and developer ergonomics. \nHubMub\n+1\n\nBlack-hat / grey-hat: what not to do (and why)\n\nDo not implement:\n\nPaid link schemes / PBNs / doorway pages / cloaking / AI-thin spam. Google’s Spam Policies explicitly forbid these and have been tightened in late 2024–2025 (site-reputation abuse / “parasite SEO”). Penalties include de-indexing or site-wide demotions. \nGoogle for Developers\n+1\n\nIf you sponsor content, label links rel=\"sponsored\"; user-generated links should be nofollow/ugc. \nGoogle for Developers\n\nIf you still want a “grey-hat” lever: focus on digital PR (original data studies), scholarship/award pages (real initiatives), and partner content with editorial value. Avoid tactics that resemble doorway/parasite patterns—the August 2025 spam update increased enforcement. \nProceed Innovative\n\n90-day roadmap (owner: Growth Engineering)\n\nDays 1–30 (foundations)\n\nDecide brand split (Pynn B2B vs AngelHive marketplace).\n\nShip schema (Org, Product, FAQ) on all static pages.\n\nBuild entity store (companies, people, funds) and SSG pipeline to publish 2–5k public entity pages (unique value blocks + canonicals).\n\nLaunch two interactive tools with shareable result URLs.\n\nDays 31–60 (content & distribution)\n\nPublish country/vertical directories; add FAQ/How-to hub; start digital PR cadence (1 data story every 3 weeks).\n\nOnboard 5 partners/tenants to co-publish curated lists (with backlinks).\n\nDays 61–90 (scale & monetize)\n\nExpand to 10–15k programmatic pages; add report snippets (redacted but indexable) with canonical links to the app.\n\nRelease Q1 “State of EU Seed” + webinar + newsletter swaps; measure lift in impressions, clicks, and referring domains.\n\nTarget KPIs by day 90: +300% indexed pages, +150 referring domains, 30–50k organic sessions/month (from near-zero), 100+ free trial signups/month.\n\nRisks & mitigations\n\nDuplicate content across tenants → enforce per-tenant uniqueness and canonicalization; set robots rules for boilerplate. \nWomen Invest in Women\n\nBrand confusion → explicit disambiguation in titles/meta (“AngelHive — AI-assessed marketplace | not Angel Hive (.vc)”). \nangelhive.vc\n\nThin programmatic pages → every template must surface unique stats, curated links, and editorial notes (avoid doorway classification). \nGoogle for Developers\n\nAppendix — evidence & references\n\nPynn white-label positioning & pricing and cross-links to AngelHive. \nPynn\n+1\n\nTenant creation & live tenant examples. \nAngelHive\n+1\n\nAngelHive marketing/app pages. \nAngelHive\n+3\nAngelHive\n+3\nAngelHive\n+3\n\nWordPress traces / limited blog. \nAngelHive\n+1\n\nBrand collision (angelhive.vc). \nangelhive.vc\n\nPitchBook scale (revenue/traffic) & parent distribution. \ns21.q4cdn.com\n+2\nSimilarweb\n+2\n\nGoogle policies & enforcement news (2024–2025). \nGoogle for Developers\n+1\n\nSalary benchmarks (Spain/Madrid). \nPayscale\n+3\nLevels.fyi\n+3\nGlassdoor\n+3\n\nFinal note\n\nYou can make AngelHive unique—and discoverable—by turning your AI evaluation engine into public, link-worthy knowledge (entities, tools, research) while keeping the transactional experience behind auth.
